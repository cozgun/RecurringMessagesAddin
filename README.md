This is an Outlook addin for setting up recurring e-mail messages by using calendar appointments. 
Dealing with dynamic dates is possible with embedded date variables.

As a finance professional I have developed and been using a modified version of this addin for some time in my day to day tasks.  This is a generic version for others' use regardless of the field of profession performed. 

Addin is offering four main functions.  

1. Sending plain e-mail messages with attachments.

Function Name: 
Send Recurring Email

Description:
This function sends plain e-mails without any attachments.  

How to use:
	You should enter your e-mail body text into appointment’s location field.  
	You should enter your recipients into appointment’s body field
	You should enter your e-mail subject into appointment’s title field
	Select (or first create) category named “SendRecurringEmail”.
	Turn on reminder.  Set recurrence frequency.  All done.
	When the appointment’s reminder pops out macro/function will run.
	You should dismiss the reminder after it pops out to avoid possible duplicate e-mail submissions.
